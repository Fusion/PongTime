 PongTime
 --------
 
 PongTime is a Pong Clock for Android phones (v1.5+). Runs smoothly
 on a Motorola Milestone/Droid. If screen updates stutter, try to
 shutdown background tasks.
 
 Some corners in the source are a bit ugly, due to optimizations. Mostly 
 avoiding object creation and garbage collection.
 
 License is BSD style, see LICENSE.
 
 Feel free to do whatever you want with it. Enjoy.
